## Description
Minimalist and organised neovim config inspired by and credit to:
- [tokieory/neovim-boilerplate](https://github.com/tokiory/neovim-boilerplate)
- [franz-johansson/lazy-nvim-starter](https://github.com/frans-johansson/lazy-nvim-starter)
- [ThePrimeagen/init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
Design has been carried out for use with a (moonlander keyboard using this layout)[(https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/d7lan/latest/0)
] but should be usable on any regular keyboard

## Aims
- Simplicity
  - _Use as few things as reasonably practicable but provide a IDE-like experience_
- Good documentation
  - _Files must be commented and documentation must be up do date_ 
- Go with the grain
  - _Use the built in vim commands as much as possible and only remap where necessary_

## System Requirements
- [Nerdfont (used by the filetree)](required for the file tree)](https://webinstall.dev/nerdfont/)
- [Ripgrep (used by the fuzzy finder)](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

## Use it
- Remove your current config: `rm -rf $HOME/.config/nvim`
- Make a directory to house your config: `mkdir $HOME/.config/nvim`
- Put this config in that folder: `git clone https://github.com/alunturner/neovim $HOME/.config/nvim`
